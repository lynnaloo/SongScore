The Pop Music Generator

Requires App Engine SDK 1.7.0, as well as all the jars in lib/ and war/WEB-INF/lib/

Whenever the app is deployed, you'll need to populate the database with all the rhymes. 
You can do this by entering in `Admin: load words` as the seed line. You only need to 
do this once. (Although locally the database gets wiped out frequently unless you set it
not to, I think.)
